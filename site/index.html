  Authoritarianism is spreading worldwide. Now more than ever, our online data could cause unprecedented harm in the wrong hands.

  **Tell every company on the web:** Technology should spread freedom, not tyranny. We are your users, customers, and employees, calling on you to keep your technology from doing harm: [secure our conversations, data, and devices](). We will hold you accountable until you do.

  <h2>What's happening?</h2>

  <p class="question">The Problem.</p>
  <p class="answer">Government and corporate attacks on human rights to privacy, security, and liberty are increasing across the globe, and technology plays a central role in extending their reach. Technology can empower and grant freedoms to us all, but now our online data is empowering data brokers, ISP’s, surveillance companies, and runaway government agencies to discriminate and limit freedoms. If an authoritarian government wanted a registry of everyone affiliated with a certain racial, religious, or political group, they could build it with the information collected on innocent people by technology and social media companies. Even without willing compliance, governments exploit weak links in Internet security and the massive troves of data companies have on people through secret orders and security vulnerabilities. They can twist the Internet into something it was never meant to be: a weapon against the public.</p>

  <p class="question">The Solution.</p>
  <p class="answer">We may not be able to prevent all forms of surveillance, but we <b>can</b> stop abuses of our data and authoritarian tools like discriminatory registries by building a surveillance-resistant web. We're calling on companies to build proven security into every service, site, and technology, while also arming users with the information to make informed choices about what services to use. We're already part way there, and what is left to do is within reach.
</p>
  <p class="question">The Plan.</p>
  <p class="answer">The goal is to get thousands of the sites & apps we use every day to pledge to secure our data and get millions of people using secure services. As users, we are demanding companies on the web take these steps and we're [recognizing vetted, secure tools]() so that everyone can choose the services that protect their privacy and security. As tech employees, we are working inside our companies to push them to do the right thing. Together, we'll take online and direct action to shut off mass surveillance channels for any unchecked power, including federal agencies like the NSA. Over the course of 2017, we will acknowledge those companies that have taken these steps and draw public awareness to those that have left us vulnerable.
</p>
  <p class="question">The Pledge.</p>
  <p class="answer">As an Internet user, private information about us and our community ends up in the hands of corporations and governments, with fewer and fewer protections governing how that data is tracked, stored, and used. We are committed to calling on companies to do their part to secure our data, and by the end of 2017, we pledge to [take meaningful steps]() to protect our information with vetted, secure tools.

    <br/>
    
As technology companies, you recognize that you have a key role to play. You decide how the services you build collect, capture, and share our data. In 2017, companies that sign this pledge are committing to ensuring their products and services do not put human rights at risk by agreeing to:

</p>
<ul class="pledged">
<span></span>

<li> <span class="number">1</span>Protect our conversations: We use the Internet to communicate everything, from sensitive banking information to working with others. Offer publicly accessible and auditable end-to-end encryption, by default wherever possible.</li>

<li><span class="number">2</span>Data can last forever and harm people in unpredictable ways. The best way to guard against that harm is to not collect or store it. Review your data collection practices, and stop collecting and storing information that isn't necessary for your product or business. Commit to not requesting information about your customers’ and employees’ immigration status, national origin, nationality, or religion, unless required by law or by the service being provided, and do not provide information about this sensitive information to the public or government officials unless required by a court order. By default, data that is not necessary for business practices should be purged immediately. If data is retained, customers should be clearly informed and have to opt-in to retention, sharing, or use of information.
</li> 

<li><span class="number">3</span>Protect our devices: if our laptops, phones, and Internet-connected devices get hacked, our rights are put at risk. This risk increases when gadget and phone makers betray their customers by failing to update connected devices to guard against evolving security threats. Commit to providing updates to your products when necessary, and notifying customers in the case of breach or identified vulnerabilities. When other companies you work with fail to keep devices updated, aggressively warn users and potential buyers about them.
</li>

<li><span class="number">4</span>Block government overreach: Pledge to fight overly broad, questionable, and illegal efforts to surveil your users, in the courts and in public. Publish transparency reports detailing requests from governments to the greatest extent allowed by law, and provide notice to individual customers or users whose records are sought or obtained by the government unless barred from doing so. Prohibit the use of your products and services, especially your APIs, to collect information about your customers and users for governmental surveillance purposes. Commit to not voluntarily providing customer information to the government, unless necessary in an emergency to safeguard life. Commit to advocating for reform of our national security surveillance authorities, including by urging reform of Section 702 of FISA and Executive Order 12333. Support reforms at the federal and state level that require a warrant before the government can demand content, location, and other sensitive data from companies. Support immigration policies that ensure immigrants (including your own employees) are treated humanely, receive due process, and are not discriminated against through travel bans.

</li>
  </ul>

<p>In the coming weeks, we will be working with Internet users and employees across the tech industry to urge your companies to take this pledge. Over the course of 2017, we will celebrate those companies that have taken these steps and draw public awareness to those that have left us vulnerable. </p>
